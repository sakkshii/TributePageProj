            Bhanot applied for a flight attendant job with Pan Am,
             when in 1985 it decided to have an all Indian cabin crew for its Frankfurt to India routes.
              Upon selection, she went to Miami, Florida for training as a flight attendant,
               but returned as a purser. She also had a successful modelling career simultaneously during 
               her work at Pan Am.
